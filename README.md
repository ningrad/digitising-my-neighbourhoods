# digitising-my-neighbourhoods
TBH this is my first personal project. 
To reconnect with my surroundings, I decided to start a small mapping project focused on digitizing the houses in my neighborhood. Using QGIS and OpenStreetMap data as a base, I manually digitized each house and created simple attribute data containing the house identifier (coded for privacy), the family name, and the number of residents.
To maintain confidentiality, I replaced real names with numerical codes and stored all information in a private local dataset.
